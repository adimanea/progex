#+TITLE: (Today) I Learned
#+AUTHOR: Adrian Manea

Here are some shortcuts to the most important things I learned while doing these exercises.
They may not be the optimal solutions, but they work.

* (C) Linking headers at compilation
If a C program uses some external header files (such as =math.h=), when compiling with =gcc=,
the explicit linking of the libraries is needed, with the =-lm= flag at compilation:
#+begin_src sh
  $ $ gcc ex1.c -o ex1.o -lm
#+end_src

* (C) Reading from file, one character at a time
#+begin_src c
  int main() {
	char c;
	FILE *fp;
	int n;

	fp = fopen("file", "r");

	if (fp == NULL) return 0;		/* cannot read file */

	while ((c = fgetc(fp)) != EOF)
	  /* do something with c */
	  n = c - '0';				/* storing c as digit */

	fclose(fp);
  
	return 0;
  }  
#+end_src

* (C) Reading numbers from file
#+begin_src c
  int main() {
	FILE *fp;
	int x;

	fp = fopen("file", "r");
	if (fp == NULL) return 0;

	fscanf(fp, "%d", &x);		    /* read first int */
	while (!feof(fp)) {
	  /* do something with x */
	  fscanf(fp, "%d", &x);		/* read next int */
	}

	fclose(fp);

	return 0;
  }
#+end_src
