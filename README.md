# Programming Exercises

This repository contains various programming exercises that I am using to
practice some programming languages I want to learn and/or improve.

The exercises will mostly be taken from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
and [Exercism](https://exercism.io/).

First languages of focus: C, C++ and Python.
