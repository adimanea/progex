# Programming Exercises

This repository contains various programming exercises that I am using to
practice some programming languages I want to learn and/or improve.

The exercises will mostly be taken from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)
and [Exercism](https://exercism.io/).

Will probably delve also into:
- [r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/new/);
- [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/problemset);
- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/problems/school/?itm_medium=navmenu&itm_campaign=problems);
- [Timus](https://acm.timus.ru/problemset.aspx);
- [infoarena](https://infoarena.ro/arhiva);
- [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/);
- [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/problems).

First languages of focus: C, C++ and Python.

The main novelties I learn are in `til.org` here.
